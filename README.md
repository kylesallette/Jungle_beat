### Linked Lists

Linked Lists are one of the most fundamental Computer Science data structures. A Linked List models a collection of data as a series of "nodes" which link to one another in a chain.

In a singly-linked list (the type we will be building) you have a __head__, which is a node representing the "start" of the list, and subsequent nodes which make up the remainder of the list.

The __list__ itself can hold a reference to one thing -- the head node.

Each node can hold a single element of data and a link to the next node in the list.

The last node of the list is often called its __tail__.
